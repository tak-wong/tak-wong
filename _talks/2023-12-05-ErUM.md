## Description
The Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon is operating imaging beamlines for X-ray tomography (P05 IBL, P07 HEMS) for academic and industrial users at the synchrotron radiation source PETRA III at DESY in Hamburg, Germany. The high X-ray flux density and coherence of synchrotron radiation enable high-resolution in situ/operando tomography experiments. Here, large amounts of 4D data are collected from a wide variety of samples, which is challenging to reconstruct, process, and analyze. In this multi-disciplinary project - KI4D4E, we utilize modern machine learning methods for the data processing of synchrotron-radiation tomography experiments, such as micro- and nano-CT simulation, denoising and artifact removal, phase retrieval, and digital volume correlation, which are applied to the data analysis of biodegradable implant materials. In this talk, we will present the challenges and methodologies to solve inverse problems (e.g. 3D optical flow) based on the volumetric data by supervised/unsupervised learning.
