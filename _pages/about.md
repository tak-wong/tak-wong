I am a scientist at [Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon](https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en) working at the outstation located at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/index_eng.html), Hamburg.
Currently, I am a joint member of [Imaging and Data Science Department](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/metallic_biomaterials/imaging_and_data_science/index.php.en) of the [Institute of Metallic Biomaterials](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/metallic_biomaterials/index.php.en) and the [X-Ray Imaging with Synchrotron Radiation Department](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/team/index.php.en) of the [Institute of Materials Physics](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/index.php.en).

Before this, I completed my doctoral research at the [Computer Graphics and Multimedia Systems Group](https://www.cg.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Andreas Kolb](https://www.cg.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/kolb-andreas) at the [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de) in May 2023.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in deep learning, non-convex optimization, computational imaging, computer graphics and computer vision.
Most of my research is about applying computational approaches to image analysis for imaging modalities, such as Synchrotron radiation-based micro-/nano- Computed Tomography, Terahertz (THz) imaging, Time-of-Flight, hyperspectral imaging, etc.

News
======
- 24.04.2024: Our paper is accepted by CVPR 2024 workshops - Computer Vision for Materials Science (CV4MS).
