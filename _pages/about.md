I am a scientist at [Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon](https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en) working at the outstation located at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/index_eng.html), Hamburg.
Currently, I am a joint member of [Imaging and Data Science Department](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/metallic_biomaterials/imaging_and_data_science/index.php.en) of the [Institute of Metallic Biomaterials](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/metallic_biomaterials/index.php.en) and [X-Ray Imaging with Synchrotron Radiation](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/team/index.php.en) of the [Institute of Materials Physics](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/materials_physics/index.php.en).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in computer vision, deep learning, computational imaging, computer graphics and computer vision.
Most of my research is about applying computational approaches to image analysis for imaging modalities, such as Terahertz (THz) imaging, Synchrotron radiation-based micro-/nano- Computed Tomography, Time-of-Flight, hyperspectral imaging, etc.
